rem  Run this ONCE after copying the app folder onto the kiosk PC.
rem  It creates a Desktop shortcut that launches run.bat through
rem  cmd.exe, which is what lets Windows allow the shortcut to be
rem  pinned to the taskbar afterwards (Windows blocks pinning .bat
rem  files directly, but allows pinning a shortcut whose target is
rem  an .exe such as cmd.exe).
